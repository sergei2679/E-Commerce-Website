						<h2>Golden Retriever</h2>
						<p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes him a fabulous family pet, and his intelligence makes him a highly capable working dog. Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out drugs, and as therapy and assistance dogs. They’re also natural athletes, and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Sporting Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: <br> Male	22–24 in (56–61 cm) <br> Female	20-22 in (51-56 cm)</li>
							<li>Weight: <br> Male	65–75 lb (29–34 kg) <br> Female	55–65 lb (25–29 kg)</li>
							<li>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Golden Retrievers shed profusely, especially in the spring and fall. Daily brushing will get some of the loose hair out of the coat, keeping it from settling on your clothing and all over your house. But if you live with a Golden, you'll have to get used to dog hair.</li>
							<li>Golden Retrievers are family dogs; they need to live indoors with their human "pack," and shouldn't spend hours alone in the backyard.</li>
							<li>Golden Retrievers are active dogs who need 40-60 minutes of hard exercise daily. They thrive on obedience training, agility classes, and other canine activities, which are a great way to give your dog physical and mental exercise.</li>
							<li>Although they're gentle and trustworthy with kids, Golden Retrievers are boisterous, large dogs that can accidentally knock over a small child.</li>
							<li>Goldens love to eat, and will quickly become overweight if overfed. Limit treats, measure out your dog's daily kibble, and feed him in regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time.</li>
							<li>Because the Golden Retriever is so popular, there are many people breeding Goldens who care more about making money out of the demand for puppies than in breeding happy, healthy dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>A sweet, calm nature is the hallmark of the breed. The Golden was bred to work with people, and is eager to please his owner. Though hard-wired with a good disposition, like all dogs the Golden must be well-raised and well-trained to make the most of his heritage.</p>
						<p>Like every dog, the Golden needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Golden puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>As indicated by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds in small amounts throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds in the spring and fall. It usually lies flat against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>Golden Retrievers are built for action and love outdoor romps. If you like to hike or jog, your Golden will be happy to join you. And if you feel like tossing a ball in the backyard, they'd be more than happy to join you; true to their name, Goldens love to retrieve.</p>
						<p>Tiring them out with 20-30 minutes of vigorous exercise twice a day will keep your dog mellow when he's back inside. Slacking on the activity, however, could lead to behavior problems.</p>
						<p>Like other retriever breeds, Goldens are naturally "mouthy," and they're happiest when they have something to carry in their mouths: a ball, soft toy, newspaper, or best of all, a smelly sock.</p>
						<p>You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Golden puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. Don't let your Golden puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until he's at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes.</p>

						<h2>Labrador Retriever</h2>
						<p>The Labrador Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, he earned his keep as a fisherman’s helper: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic. Today’s Labrador Retriever is as good-natured and hard working as his ancestors, and he’s America’s most popular breed. These days the Lab works as a retriever for hunters, assistance dog to the handicapped, show competitor, and search and rescue dog, among other canine jobs.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Sporting Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: <br>Male 22.5 to 24.5 in (57 to 62 cm)<br>Female 21.5 to 23.5 in (55 to 60 cm)</li>
							<li>Weight: <br>Male	65–80 lb (29–36 kg) <br> Female	55–70 lb (25–32 kg) </li>
							<li>Life Span: 10 to 12 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Labrador Retrievers love, love, love to eat, and become obese very quickly if overfed. Limit treats, give your Lab plenty of exercise, and measure out regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time. And be warned that the Lab's large appetite extends to people food and even inedible items. Labradors will forage in garbage, counter surf, and can make a meal out of chewed-up items like children's toys.</li>
							<li>Labrador Retrievers were bred for physically demanding jobs, and they have the high energy that goes along with being a working breed. They need at least 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. Without it, they can vent their pent-up energy in destructive ways, such as barking and chewing.</li>
							<li>Labs have such a good reputation that many people think they don't need to bother with training. But Labs are large, energetic animals, and like all dogs, they need to be taught good canine manners. Sign up for puppy and obedience classes as soon as you bring your Lab home.</li>
							<li>Many people think of Labs as a hyperactive breed. Lab puppies are definitely lively, but most will slow down a bit as they grow up. However, they usually remain fairly active throughout their lives.</li>
							<li>Labrador Retrievers are not known to be escape artists, but with the right motivation — such as a whiff of something yummy — a Lab will take off. Make sure your Lab has current identification tags and a microchip.</li>
							<li>The Lab is America's number one dog, which means there are plenty of people breeding Labs who are more interested in filling the demand for Lab puppies than in breeding healthy dogs with good temperaments. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>The Lab has the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured breeds, and it's well deserved. He's outgoing, eager to please, and friendly with both people and other animals. Aside from a winning personality, he has the intelligence and eagerness to please that make him easy to train. Training is definitely necessary because this breed has a lot of energy and exuberance. The working heritage of the Lab means he is active. This breed needs activity, both physical and mental, to keep him happy. There is some variation in the activity level of Labs: some are rowdy, others are more laid back. All thrive on activity.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.</p>
						<p>Labrador Retrievers are registered in three colours: black (a solid black colour), yellow (considered from cream to fox-red), and chocolate (medium to dark brown). Some dogs are sold as silver pure-bred Labradors, but purity of those bloodlines is currently disputed by breed experts including breed clubs and breed councils. Some major kennel clubs around the world allow silver Labradors to be registered, but not as silver.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>The lovable Lab needs to be around his family, and is definitely not a backyard dog. If he's left alone for too long, he'll probably tarnish his saintly reputation: A lonely, bored Lab is apt to dig, chew, or find other destructive outlets for his energy. Labs show some variation in their activity levels, but all of them need activity, both physical and mental. Daily 30-minute walks, a romp at the dog park, or a game of fetch, are a few ways to help your Lab burn off energy. However, a puppy should not be taken for too long walks and should play for a few minutes at a time. Labrador Retrievers are considered "workaholics," and will exhaust themselves. It is up to you to end play and training sessions. Labs have such good reputations that some owners think they don't need training. That's a big mistake. Without training, a rambunctious Lab puppy will soon grow to be a very large, rowdy dog. Luckily, Labs take to training well — in fact, they often excel in obedience competitions. Start with puppy kindergarten, which not only teaches your pup good canine manners, but helps him learn how to be comfortable around other dogs and people. Look for a class that uses positive training methods that reward the dog for getting it right, rather than punishing him for getting it wrong. You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Lab puppy. Don't let your Lab puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until he's at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, as is puppy agility, with its one-inch jumps. Like all retrievers, the Lab is mouthy, and he's happiest when he has something, anything, to carry in his mouth. He's also a chewer, so be sure to keep sturdy toys available all the time — unless you want your couch chewed up. And when you leave the house, it's wise to keep your Lab in a crate or kennel so he's can't get himself into trouble chewing things he shouldn't.</p>

						<h2>Pug</h2>
						<p>Pugs often are described as a lot of dog in a small space. These sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Club’s Toy group, and are known as the clowns of the canine world because they have a great sense of humor and like to show off. Originally bred to be a lap dog, the Pug thrives on human companionship.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Companion Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: 10 inches to 1 foot, 2 inches tall at the shoulder</li>
							<li>Weight: 14 to 18 pounds</li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Pugs can be stubborn and difficult to housebreak. Crate training is recommended.</li>
							<li>Pugs can't tolerate high heat and humidity because of a short muzzle (air cools down when it passes through the noses of dogs with longer muzzles before entering the lungs). When your Pug is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating. Pugs are definitely housedogs and should not be kept outdoors.</li>
							<li>Despite their short coats, Pugs shed a lot. Pugs wheeze, snort and snore, loudly. Because their eyes are so prominent, Pugs are prone to eye injuries.</li>
							<li>Pugs are greedy eaters and will overeat if given the chance. Since they gain weight easily, they can quickly become obese if food intake isn't monitored carefully.</li>
							<li>Pugs need human constant human companion. If you own a Pug, expect him to follow you around in the house, sit in your lap, and want to sleep in bed with you.</li>
							<li>Pug enthusiasts are a fun-loving bunch. They love Pug get-togethers, Pug parades, and dressing up their Pugs.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>Don't expect a Pug to hunt, guard or retrieve. Pugs were bred to be companions, and that's exactly what they do best. The Pug craves affection — and your lap — and is very unhappy if his devotion isn't reciprocated. He tends to be a sedentary dog, content to sit in your lap as you read a book or watch a movie. This doesn't mean the Pug is a stick-in-the-mud. Au contraire. He is a playful, comical dog that enjoys living it up, and delights his owner with silly antics.</p>
						<p>Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Like every dog, the Pug needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pug puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>Even though the coats are short, Pugs are a double-coated breed. Pugs are typically fawn-colored or black. The fawn color can have different tints, such as apricot or silver, and all Pugs have a short, flat, black muzzle.</p>
						<p>The coat is short and smooth, but don't be deceived. Pugs shed like crazy, especially in summer. The wise Pug owner accepts this, and adjusts her wardrobe accordingly, wearing light-colored clothing that better hides hair.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>Though playful and rambunctious, the Pug is a low-maintenance companion, making it ideal for older owners. Because they are a small, quiet breed and are relatively inactive when indoors, they are a good choice for apartment dwellers as well.</p>
						<p>Their compact package belies a great deal of energy, so expect to be entertained with some goofy antics if your Pug doesn't get a walk or some playtime. They are sensitive to heat and humidity, however, so if you live in a hot or humid environment, be sure your Pug doesn't spend too much time outside. Light sleepers may also want to invest in a pair of ear plugs — Pugs are prone to snore.</p>

					<div class="pet-info right">
						<h2>German Shepherd Dog</h2>
						<p>The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds—for good reason. They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly versatile, excelling at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and–last but not least–faithful companion.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Herding Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: <br> Male	60–65 cm (24–26 in) <br> Female	55–60 cm (22–24 in) </li>
							<li>Weight: <br> Male	30–40 kg (66–88 lb) <br> Female	22–33 kg (49–73 lb) </li>
							<li>Life Span: 10 to 14 years</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The German Shepherd isn't the breed for you if you're away from home frequently or for long periods of time. When left alone, they can become anxious or bored and are likely to express their worry in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging.</li>
							<li>German Shepherds are active and intelligent dogs. They must be kept busy learning, playing, and working. Daily exercise, both physical (such as jogging and Frisbee) and mental (such as training sessions), is a must.</li>
							<li>German Shepherds can be aloof and suspicious of strangers. To raise a social and well-behaved dog, expose your German Shepherd puppy to many experiences, places, and people. Obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is important for getting them used to other people and dogs, as well as teaching them basic canine manners.</li>
							<li>Crate training is not only a wonderful way to housetrain a puppy, it helps teach them to be calm and happy when separated from their owner. This is especially important for the German Shepherd, who sometimes suffers separation anxiety, or extreme anxiety when left alone.</li>
							<li>They've got a reputation for being a great watchdog—and they are—but the German Shepherd should never be chained or tethered just to stand guard. No dog should; it leads to frustration and aggression. The German Shepherd is happiest living indoors with the family, but with access to a large, fenced yard, where they can burn off some of their natural energy.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>The German Shepherd personality is aloof but not usually aggressive. They're reserved dogs; they don't make friends immediately, but once they do, they're extremely loyal. With their family, they're easy-going and approachable, but when threatened, they can be strong and protective, making them excellent watchdogs. This highly intelligent and trainable breed thrives on having a job to do—any job. The German Shepherd can be trained to do almost anything, from alerting a deaf person to a doorbell ring to sniffing out an avalanche victim. One thing they're not good at is being alone for long periods of time.</p>
						<p>Without the companionship they need—as well as exercise and the chance to put their intelligence to work—they become bored and frustrated. A German Shepherd who's under-exercised and ignored by their family is likely to express pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking and chewing. Like every dog, the German Shepherd needs early socialization—exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences—when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your German Shepherd puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>The German Shepherd was originally bred to herd flocks in harsh climates, and their medium-length double coat fits the job perfectly, acting as protection the dog from rain and snow and resistant to picking up burrs and dirt. The coat types of the German Shepherd are as varied as their color. Some German Shepherds are longhaired. However, the "ideal" German Shepherd has a double coat of medium length. The outer coat is dense with straight hair that lies close to the body, and is sometimes wavy and wiry. The coat comes in variety of colors and patterns including black; black and cream; black and red; black and silver; black and tan; blue; gray; liver; sable; and white. The American Kennel Club doesn't recognize white as a color for this breed, however, and won't let white German Shepherds compete in conformation shows, although they're allowed in other competitions. Sometimes jokingly called "German shedders," the breed sheds year-round, and generally "blows"—sheds a lot of hair at once, like a snowstorm—twice a year. If you want a German Shepherd, be prepared for hair on your black pants, on your white couch, and pretty much all over the house. There's no magic solution to shedding, and we just have to accept it.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>Originally bred to herd flocks all day, German Shepherds are built for action. This means they've got lots of energy that they need to burn off with daily exercise. If you leave them alone for long periods of time without exercise, expect trouble. Boredom and inactivity lead to behavior problems—chewing, digging, and barking. The German Shepherd desperately needs to exercise both their body (jogging, a romp at the dog park) and their mind (training exercises like agility or obedience competitions). Like many herding breeds, German Shepherds are barkers. Barking isn't necessarily a problem, but it can be if the dog is bored.</p>
						<p>Learning the "Quiet" command should be part of every German Shepherd's obedience training. German Shepherds like to chew, and their powerful jaws can destroy most materials. If they pick the wrong thing to gnaw on, they can damage their teeth, swallow something that makes them sick, or even choke. Save your dog, and your belongings, by giving them safe chew toys and bones so they can entertain themselves when you're not playing with them.</p>

				<!-- Belgian Malinois -->
				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info left">
						<h2>Belgian Malinois</h2>
						<p>Canines of the Belgian Malinois dog breed were originally bred to be herding dogs. Today, they also work as police dogs, protection dogs, and family companions. In the hands of an experienced dog person, they are intense, intelligent and athletic companions.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Herding Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: <br> Male	61–66 cm (24–26 in) <br> Female	56–61 cm (22–24 in) </li>
							<li>Weight: <br> Male	25–30 kg (55–66 lb) <br> Female	22–25 kg (49–55 lb) </li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 14 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Belgian Malinois have a great deal of energy and need a lot of exercise. Make sure you have the room and time to provide it.</li>
							<li>Malinois are very intelligent and alert. They also have strong herding and protection instincts. Early, consistent training is critical!</li>
							<li>Although they are good-size dogs, they are very people-oriented and want to be included in family activities.</li>
							<li>Malinois are constant shedders. They shed heavily twice a year.</li>
							<li>Belgian Malinois are intense dogs that are play-oriented and sensitive. Training should be fun, consistent, and positive.</li>
							<li>Because of their intelligence, high energy, and other characteristics, Malinois are not recommended for inexperienced dog owners.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>This is an outstanding working dog who is confident and protective in any situation. He's affectionate with family members but reserved toward strangers until he takes their measure. The watchdog abilities of the Malinois are excellent. He protects his people and property with only as much force as is required. Shyness and aggression are never appropriate in this breed. That said, temperament doesn't just happen. It's affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. </p>
						<p>Like every dog, Malinois need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Malinois puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>Due to its history as a working dog (i.e., being bred for function over form), the Malinois can vary greatly in appearance. The acceptable colors of pure-bred Malinois are a base color fawn to mahogany and tan with a black mask and black ears with some degree of black tipping on the hairs, giving an overlay appearance. The color tends to be lighter with less black agouti or overlay on the dog's underside, breeching, and inner leg. White markings are also allowed on the tips of the toes and the chest. A Belgian malinois may have a longer and darker hair coat than the typical malinois, but may still be referred to as a Belgian malinois.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>Belgian Malinois can do well in small quarters if they receive enough exercise. They prefer cool climates but adapt well to warmer environments. They do best when they are allowed to be a part of the family and are able to live indoors at least part of the time. If possible, provide your Malinois with some off-leash exercise in a fenced area in addition to long walks or jogging. Malinois need about 20 minutes of activity three or four times a day, and a leisurely walk won't satisfy them. They're built for action. If you like to hike or jog, your Belgian Malinois will be happy to be by your side. Consider training him to compete in obedience or agility. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you keep him active. Don't be surprised if he runs in large circles in your yard; it's a remnant of his herding heritage. Puppies have different exercise needs. </p>
						<p>From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes, daily half-mile walks, and playtime in the yard will meet their needs. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he's a year old, your Malinois pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as asphalt and concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Malinois are sensitive and highly trainable. Be firm, calm, and consistent with them. Anger and physical force are counterproductive.</p>

						<h2>American Foxhound</h2>
						<p>Easygoing, sweet, kind, and loyal, the American Foxhound dog breed belongs to a way of life that has continued for more than two centuries, but he has the potential to be a modern-day companion as well. His stamina and love of running make him a great jogging partner for athletic owners, and his mild nature makes him an excellent family dog, so long as he gets the exercise he craves.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Hound Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: 21–25 in (53–64 cm)</li>
							<li>Weight: 55–71 lb (25–32 kg)</li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 13 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The Foxhound is famed for his musical voice and his bays and howls can carry for miles; city living is not recommended for this breed.</li>
							<li>Foxhounds are easily distracted by various scents. Once he has decided to follow one, you'll have a difficult time calling him off. Foxhounds aren't homebodies and will roam if given the chance.</li>
							<li>Foxhounds are extremely active and need one to two hours a day of exercise. Take them on long, meandering walks with lots of sniffing time or take them on a run with you.</li>
							<li>Foxhounds aren't suited to living in cramped quarters; they need a large yard or, better yet, an acre or two. Foxhounds love to eat and easily gain weight if their food intake isn't strictly controlled.</li>
							<li>Foxhounds can be stubborn and independent, making training a challenge. Obedience training is important, however, to develop a better relationship with your dog and establish your position as leader of the pack.</li>
							<li>Foxhounds are gentle and tolerant and love children. They enjoy the company of other dogs and can learn to get along with cats if introduced to them at an early age.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>While they're mainly sweet and easygoing, American Foxhounds have the independent and stubborn nature that's common to hounds. They've been bred to hunt with very little direction from their human companions, and they don't necessarily see why they should have to do things your way.</p>
						<p>Foxhounds who've been raised in the company of other dogs, rather than with a human family, can be challenging because they've bonded more with their pack than with people. They'll need more time, attention, and training to help them get used to life as a family dog. Like every dog, Foxhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, dogs, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps a Foxhound puppy grow up to be a friendly, well-rounded dog.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>American Foxhounds have a medium-length coat that lies close to the body and has a hard texture, protecting the hound from brush and briars in the field. The coat comes in many colors; as the saying goes, no good hound is a bad color.</p>
						<p>American Foxhounds are a brush-and-go breed. A once-over with a firm bristle brush once a week removes dirt and distributes the skin oils that keep the coat healthy. You don't need to bathe your Foxhound regularly — only when you notice a strong doggy smell or he's gotten into something grimy.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>Bred to be a fast hunter who can run for miles, the American Foxhound needs a substantial amount of exercise. If he's not going to be a hunting companion, he'll need daily runs or some other form of exercise to help him burn off his natural energy. He's best suited to a home with a yard — or better yet, an acre or two; he's probably too loud for condo or apartment living. Often raised in outdoor kennels with a pack of dogs, the American Foxhound is used to roughing it, and can live outdoors if he's got a good shelter and another social dog to keep him company. If he's an only dog, however, he should live indoors with his human pack so he won't get lonely.</p>
						<p>Obedience training is highly recommended to help the independent Foxhound view you as leader of the pack. He won't respond well to punishment-based training, so use treats and praise to reward him for doing as you ask. And "ask" is the operative word. Hounds will flat-out ignore you if you try to boss them around. Keep an old Southern adage in mind when training an American Foxhound: you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.</p>

				<!-- Cocker Spaniel -->
				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info left">
						<h2>Cocker Spaniel</h2>
						<p>The Cocker Spaniel is primarily a beloved companion dog breed, though he remains a capable bird dog at heart. Beautiful to look at (and labor-intensive to groom), the Cocker’s amenable, cheerful disposition also makes him a treat to have in the family. Never more pleased than when he’s pleasing you, he’s as happy to snuggle on the couch with his favorite adults as to romp in the yard with the kids.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group:</li>
							<li>Height: 15.5–16 inches (39–41 cm)</li>
							<li>Weight: 28–32 pounds (13–15 kg)</li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Because Cockers are so popular, it is especially careful to research breeders and find one who is dedicated to improving the breed.</li>
							<li>The sensitive Cocker Spaniel can be a bit nervous, even when he's from a good breeder and has been properly socialized. Don't be surprised if your Cocker exhibits submissive urination (peeing when excited).</li>
							<li>Cockers can be barkers, so response to a "Quiet" command should always be part of this dog's repertoire.</li>
							<li>The Cocker is eager to please and likes to be close to his family. But remember, he was bred to be a hunting dog. Don't be surprised when he chases birds or other small animals when you're out on a walk. Keep your Cocker on a leash whenever you aren't in a fenced area.</li>
							<li>The Cocker has a "soft" personality. Harsh training methods will make him fearful, so be sure to use gentle, consistent training to get the best results.</li>
							<li>A Cocker Spaniel's long ears are both a part of his beauty and a potential health problem. Be sure to check your Cocker's ears every week for infections. Keeping the Cocker coat beautiful is expensive and a lot of work. Plan on paying a professional groomer and on brushing the coat every day.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>The well-bred Cocker Spaniel has a sweet temperament. He is affectionate and cuddly and loves to participate in family activites. He is playful, alert, and active, enjoying any exercise from a brisk walk to hunting in the field.</p>
						<p>The Cocker is known to be a sensitive dog, mentally and physically. He has a "soft" personality and does not respond well to harsh treatment, sometimes turning to growling or snapping when he's in pain or afraid. Early socialization and training is essential to teach the Cocker appropriate canine manners. He needs to be handled carefully and kindly to bring out the best in his personality.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>There are few breeds as handsome as the well-groomed Cocker Spaniel. His thick, sometimes wavy coat is short on the head and back and long on the ears, chest, belly, and legs. The coat is a solid color (black or light cream to red to brown), or parti-color (two or more colors, one of which is white).</p>
						<p>Grooming is an intense — and potentially expensive — proposition for the Cocker Spaniel. Most owners opt to have a professional groomer bathe, brush, and trim their dogs' coats every six to eight weeks, and prices are high for this time-intensive breed. Daily brushing at home is also necessary to keep the coat free of tangles and mats. If you are hesitant about a breed that requires substantial grooming, the Cocker is not for you.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>The Cocker Spaniel is well suited to living in an apartment or condo — though of course he loves to share a house and yard. Although he doesn't need vast space to roam, he does need daily activity. A daily romp in the yard along with a brisk 30-minute walk can keep him happy and trim. Then bring him inside with you — the Cocker is not pleased to be left alone outdoors for the day, and he may respond by digging or barking to keep himself amused. He's most content when he's with his family, participating in the group's activities.</p>
						<p>Despite his beautiful locks and cute, round eyes, the Cocker Spaniel is a hunter at heart. He is also a good candidate for many canine sports, especially agility and obedience competitions, hunt tests, flyball, or tracking. Like most dogs, the Cocker is better behaved when active than when he's allowed to get bored, which can lead to such behavior problems as barking, digging, and chewing.</p>

				<!-- Alaskan Malamute -->
				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info right">
						<h2>Alaskan Malamute</h2>
						<p>The Alaskan Malamute features a powerful, sturdy body built for stamina and strength. It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Working Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: 25 inches (64 cm) </li>
							<li>Weight: 85 pounds (39 kg) </li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 15 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Not recommended for the first time dog owner as their intelligence combined with stubbornness can make them a challenge for someone not savvy in dog behavior.</li>
							<li>Malamutes will challenge for top position in the household. Everyone who lives with the dog must be able to properly deal with this and clearly establish all family members are not to be pushed around.</li>
							<li>Alaskan Malamutes are notorious diggers. Any fencing should be buried so they cannot dig out of their yard. Alaskan Malamutes are a powerful, independent dogs who, if not properly trained or exercised, can become destructive or bored.</li>
							<li>With early socialization and training, Malamutes can learn to get along with other dogs and indoor cats. They'll view outdoor cats and other small animals as fair game.</li>
							<li>Their high prey drive can cause a Malamute to stalk and kill small animals, including birds, squirrels, cats and even smaller dogs. They need to be properly socialized and introduced to other companion animals.</li>
							<li>Alaskan Malamutes shed heavily twice a year. Their thick double coats are not suited for hot climates. Generally a quiet breed, Malamutes rarely bark. They do hold conversations with you, vocally expressing themselves with "woo woo" sounds or loud, extensive howls.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>Alaskan Malamutes will win you over with their playful, outgoing dispositions. They greet everyone as a friend—even strangers and first-time house guests—so they don't make good watchdogs, but they are extremely loyal to their family and friends. Malamutes are pack animals, and they enjoy spending time with their human pack, insisting on being included in all activities that their family undertakes. They're not big-time barkers, but they do howl and they're known for making a characteristic "woo woo" sound. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. </p>
						<p>Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. You may wish to adopte the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet a dog before adopting to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up, though that's not always an option if the puppy comes from a shelter or rescue. Like every dog, Alaskan Malamutes need early socialization—exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences—when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Malamute puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking them to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help them polish their social skills.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>The Alaskan Malamute sports a dense double coat. The thick, coarse outer coat, known as the guard coat, should not be soft or long. The undercoat is one to two inches deep. It's oily and woolly to repel wetness and cold. The coat length increases around the shoulders and neck, down the back, over the rump, and in the breeches (the furry covering over the thigh, which resembles pants) and plume of the tail. Speaking of the tail, some display a "cork-screw" appearance that enables the dog to place their tail over their nose to keep them warm during cold weather. This breed's coat colors range from light gray to black, sable, and shades of sable to red.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>This member of the Working Group of dogs is definitely a task seeker. They thrive on long walks, hikes (while carrying a backpack), skijoring (pulling a person on skis), carting, and sledding. They need to run, play, and generally bounce around a lot. Inadequate exercise will cause the Alaskan Malamute to become bored and destructive. Make sure, however, that the exercise matches the dog's age, health condition, and activity level. Malamutes love to dig. Rather than trying to stop this behavior, your best bet is to accommodate it by giving your Malamute his own place to dig in the yard, such as a sandbox or other area that you don't mind setting aside for them. Blessed with a dense double coat, Alaskan Malamutes can tolerate living outdoors in extremely cold climates. However, they do need adequate shelter and a fenced enclosure, preferably with a roof over it. Because Malamutes have an extremely high pack drive, they are happiest when residing with their pack in the house. They do well living inside a home because they keep their coats clean and are easy to housetrain. Not surprisingly, Malamutes are sensitive to heat. They're Arctic dogs, not designed by nature to live in hot, humid environments. If your Malamute lives in the Sunbelt, be sure to provide them with plenty of shade, fresh water, and air conditioning during the summer, and avoid exercise in the heat of the day. Due to their size, strength, and smarts, it's highly recommended that Malamutes be enrolled in obedience training at a young age before they are large enough and strong enough to outmaneuver—or outwit—their humans.</p>

				<!-- Doberman Pinscher -->
				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info left">
						<h2>Doberman Pinscher</h2>
						<p>The Doberman Pinscher was developed in Germany during the late 19th century, primarily as a guard dog. His exact ancestry is unknown, but he’s believed to be a mixture of many dog breeds, including the Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier, and German Pinscher. With his sleek coat, athletic build, and characteristic cropped ears and docked tail, the Doberman Pinscher looks like an aristocrat. He is a highly energetic and intelligent dog, suited for police and military work, canine sports, and as a family guardian and companion.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Working Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: <br> Male	68 to 72 cm (27 to 28 in) <br> Female	63 to 68 cm (25 to 27 in) </li>
							<li>Weight: <br> Male	40–45 kg (88–99 lb) <br> Female	32–35 kg (71–77 lb) </li>
							<li>Life Span: 10 to 13 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The Doberman has a great deal of energy and needs a lot of exercise.</li>
							<li>This breed can be protective, so don't be surprised when he assumes the role of household guardian.</li>
							<li>The Dobie will assume the alpha role in your household if you're not a strong leader. Early, consistent training is critical to establish your role as pack leader.</li>
							<li>The Dobie is sensitive to cold weather and needs adequate shelter in winter (he likes to be in the house next to the fireplace).</li>
							<li>The Doberman Pinscher is a family dog and shouldn't be left alone. He thrives when he's included in family activities.</li>
							<li>The Doberman has gained a reputation as being vicious. Even though your Doberman may have a sweet personality, neighbors and strangers may be afraid of him.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>A super-intelligent and super-active dog — that's what you get when you get a Doberman Pinscher. You also get an extremely loyal, trustworthy dog who's playful and fun-loving with his family. He's a natural protector who won't hesitate to act when he thinks his family is under threat, but he is not aggressive without reason.</p>
						<p>The Dobie likes to be busy, physically and mentally. He learns quickly, and training him is easy. Because he learns so fast, it's challenging to keep lessons fresh and interesting. He can have his own ideas about things, though typically he's not overly stubborn or willful with an owner who provides consistent, kind leadership.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>The sleek, smooth Dobie coat is short and lies close to the skin. He may have a slight undercoat around the neck. His coat colors are black, red, blue, and fawn. He has rust markings above each eye; on his muzzle, throat, and chest; and on his legs and feet.</p>
						<p>The Dobie's sleek coat requires minimal grooming. He is a clean dog, with minimal doggie odor. Don't be fooled by his coat length — the short coat does shed. Weekly brushing with a grooming mitt or rubber curry is sufficient, however, as is a bath when the Dobie rolls in something that smells bad or plays in the mud. Frequent bathing, however, isn't necessary.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>The Doberman Pinscher is best suited to a suburban or country home with room for him to romp. He needs a lot of exercise every day; this demand can be tiring to owners who aren't up to the job. He needs a home with a securely fenced yard, for his safety and for the safety of people and animals who inadvertently walk into his turf. He should not be left alone for long periods of time or relegated to the backyard as an outside dog. He should not be chained, either. The Dobie needs to be part of his family, participating in all family activities.</p>
						<p>The Dobie needs early socialization and training. Like any dog, he can become timid or quarrelsome if he isn't properly socialized when he's still young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Dobie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Tail docking is usually done when pups are very young. Ear cropping, however, is the owner's responsibility, not the breeder's, and it's done by a veterinarian when the puppy is a few months old. It requires surgery and several months of care afterward. If you like the look of cropped ears, consider the care and expense as well.</p>

				<!-- Border Collie -->
				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info right">
						<h2>Border Collie</h2>
						<p>The Border Collie dog breed was developed to gather and control sheep in the hilly border country between Scotland and England. He is known for his intense stare, or “eye,” with which he controls his flock. He’s a dog with unlimited energy, stamina, and working drive, all of which make him a premier herding dog; he’s still used today to herd sheep on farms and ranches around the world. The highly trainable and intelligent Border Collie also excels in various canine sports, including obedience, flyball, agility, tracking, and flying disc competitions.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Dog Breed Group: Herding Dogs</li>
							<li>Height: <br> Male	48–56 cm (19–22 in) <br> Female	46–53 cm (18–21 in) </li>
							<li>Weight: <br> Male	14–20 kg (31–44 lb) <br> Female	12–19 kg (26–42 lb) </li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 15 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Highlights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The Border Collie is highly sensitive, often responsive to the subtlest command and seemingly able to predict his owner's desires in advance.</li>
							<li>A workaholic who thrives on mental and physical stimulation, the Border Collie must have a positive way to direct his energy. Otherwise he'll invent his own games — and he can become a problem to live with.</li>
							<li>The Border Collie will herd anything that moves, including children, cars, people on bikes, cats, and squirrels. He can become a real problem if he's allowed to roam in a neighborhood; a securely fenced yard is essential.</li>
							<li>The noisy play of young children can stimulate the Border Collie's herding instinct and cause him to nip, nudge, and bark.</li>
							<li>To prevent shyness, the Border Collie must be well socialized.</li>
							<li>The Border Collie doesn't usually roam, but his curiosity and intelligence can lead him to become an escape artist.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>Quite simply, the Border Collie is a dynamo. His personality is characteristically alert, energetic, hardworking, and smart. He learns quickly — so quickly that it's sometimes difficult to keep him challenged. This breed likes to be busy. In fact, he must be busy or he becomes bored, which leads to annoying behavior, such as barking, digging, or chasing cars. He's not a dog to lie quietly on the front porch while you sip a glass of lemonade; he thrives on activity. Remember, he was bred to run and work all day herding sheep. The Border Collie is also renowned for being highly sensitive to his handler's every cue, from a whistle to a hand signal to a raised eyebrow. Of course, the Border Collie isn't perfect. He can be strong-minded and independent, and his compulsion to herd can become misdirected. In the absence of sheep, or some kind of job, he is apt to gather and chase children, cars, or pets. He can also become fearful or shy if he isn't properly socialized as a puppy. Puppy classes and plenty of exposure to a variety of people, places, and things help the sensitive Border Collie gain confidence.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>The Border Collie breed boasts two varieties of coat: rough and smooth. Both are double coats, with a coarser outer coat and soft undercoat. The rough variety is medium length with feathering on the legs, chest, and belly. The smooth variety is short all over, usually coarser in texture than the rough variety, and feathering is minimal. His coat is most often black with a white blaze on the face, neck, feet, legs, and tail tip, with or without tan. However, he may be any bicolor, tricolor, merle, or solid color except white.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>While the Border Collie is a highly adaptable dog, he's best suited to an environment that gives him some elbow room: a city home with a securely fenced yard, or a country farm or ranch. Because he has a propensity to herd and chase, he must be protected from his not-so-bright instinct to chase cars. Regardless of the environment, he requires a great deal of mental and physical stimulation every day, and he needs an owner who is willing and able to provide that. This can be a great burden to owners who don't know what they're getting into. If you're considering a Border Collie, make sure you can provide him with a proper outlet for his natural energy and bright mind. If you don't have a farm with sheep, dog sports are a good alternative.</p>
