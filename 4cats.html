						<h2>American Shorthair</h2>
						<p>The adaptable and good-natured American Shorthair retains his hunting ability, but these days he is more likely to be a family companion.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Cat Breed Group: Shorthair</li>
							<li>Height: 8-10 in </li>
							<li>Weight: 10-15 lb </li>
							<li>Life Span: 15 to 20 years</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>The adaptable and good-natured American Shorthair retains his hunting ability, but these days he is more likely to be a family companion, a job at which he excels. He has a middle-of-the-road temperament, being calm but not comatose. The American Shorthair is moderately active and enjoys a good playtime as much as the next cat, but he’s not overly demanding of attention or activity. As befits a working class cat who has made good, he is smart and enjoys playing with puzzle toys and interactive toys. He has a sociable nature and isn’t the type to hide under the bed when visitors arrive. This is a placid cat but one that doesn’t especially like being carried around. Let him stand on his own four feet. He may or may not be a lap cat, but he will always appreciate having a spot next to you on the sofa or at the end of the bed.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>The American Shorthair has the body of a working cat: stocky, muscular and strong. His build gives him the agility and endurance he needs as a first-rate stalker, and heavily muscled legs make him capable of pouncing, jumping and climbing to get his furred or feathered prey. This is a medium-size to large cat, slightly longer than he is tall.</p>
						<p>A large head with a full-cheeked face gives the American Shorthair a sweet, open expression. He has medium-size ears that are slightly rounded at the tips and large, wide eyes. A short, thick coat comes in a large assortment of colors and patterns: solid, tabby, calico, tortoiseshell, bicolor, particolor and more. The silver classic tabby pattern is probably the most popular of them all.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>The American Shorthair’s coat is easily cared for by combing or brushing it a couple of times a week to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. The thickness of the cat’s coat and the amount it sheds vary based on climate and time of year. American Shorthairs like their meals, so they can easily become overweight. To prevent obesity, measure their food instead of free-feeding them.</p>
						<p>Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.</p>

				<!-- Birman -->
				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info right">
						<h2>Birman</h2>
						<p>The Birman communicates in a soft voice, mainly to remind you that perhaps it’s time for dinner or maybe for a nice cuddle on the sofa.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Cat Breed Group: Longhair</li>
							<li>Height: 8-10 in </li>
							<li>Weight: 8-12 lb </li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 16 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>If you like the pointed pattern of the Siamese but not the yowly voice, a Birman might be the cat for you. He is a docile, quiet cat who loves people and will follow them from room to room. Expect the Birman to want to be involved in what you’re doing, and be grateful that he’s not as bossy as the Siamese.</p>
						<p>Docile doesn’t mean dumb. The Birman is a smart cat and, of course, curious. He likes to explore his environment and has been known to get trapped underneath floors that are being replaced or to accidentally (maybe on purpose) go for a ride on top of a car. It’s a good idea to always keep tabs on where he is. He communicates in a soft voice, mainly to remind you that perhaps it’s time for dinner or maybe for a nice cuddle on the sofa. He enjoys being held and will relax in your arms like a furry baby.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>The Birman has a silky, medium-length coat in the pointed pattern of the Siamese (meaning that the color is darker on the face, ears, legs and tail), a broad, rounded head topped with medium-size ears, bright blue eyes that give him a sweet expression, and four white feet that give him the appearance of wearing little white mittens. This is a medium-size to large cat with a stocky, powerful body that belies his gentle demeanor. The medium-long to long coat has a silky texture and little undercoat, which means that it rarely mats. It forms a heavy ruff around the neck and is wavy on the belly.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>Despite the length of the Birman’s coat, it has a silky texture that doesn’t mat easily. Comb it weekly to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Birmans shed their winter coat in the spring, so you may want to comb more frequently then to remove loose hair. A warm bath can also help to loosen and remove the shedding coat. To accomplish a Birman bath, wetting the cat with a hand-held shower nozzle is often preferable to immersing him in a tub of water.</p>
						<p>Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.</p>

						<h2>British Shorthair</h2>
						<p>Full of British reserve, the Shorthair has a quiet voice and is an undemanding companion.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Cat Breed Group: Shorthair</li>
							<li>Height: 16-20 in</li>
							<li>Weight: 12-18 lb </li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 17 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>The British Shorthair is mellow and easygoing, making him an excellent family companion. He enjoys affection, but he’s not a “me, me, me” type of cat. Expect him to follow you around the house during the day, settling nearby wherever you stop. Full of British reserve, the Shorthair has a quiet voice and is an undemanding companion. He doesn’t require a lap, although he loves to sit next to you. Being a big cat, he isn’t fond of being carried around.</p>
						<p>This is a cat with a moderate activity level. He’s energetic during kittenhood, but usually starts to settle down by the time he is a year old. More mature British Shorthairs are usually couch potatoes, but adult males occasionally behave like goofballs. When they run through the house, they can sound like a herd of elephants. British Shorthairs are rarely destructive; their manners are those of a proper governess, not a soccer hooligan. They welcome guests confidently.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>With his short, thick coat, round head and cheeks, big round eyes, and rounded body, the British Shorthair resembles nothing so much as a cuddly teddy bear. His body is compact but powerful with a broad chest, strong legs with rounded paws and a thick tail with a rounded tip. The coat comes in just about any color or pattern you could wish for, including lilac, chocolate, black, white, pointed, tabby and many more. The best known color is blue (gray) and the cats are sometimes referred to as British Blues. The shorthair does not reach full physical maturity until he is 3 to 5 years old.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>The British Shorthair’s short, smooth coat is simple to groom with weekly brushing or combing to remove dead hairs. A bath is rarely necessary. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails weekly. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection.</p>
						<p>Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.</p>

				<!-- Colorpoint Shorthair -->
				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info right">
						<h2>Colorpoint Shorthair</h2>
						<p>The Colorpoint is a loyal and loving feline who will pout and pine if given little or no attention.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Cat Breed Group: Shorthair </li>
							<li>Height: 21-23 in </li>
							<li>Weight: 5-12 lb </li>
							<li>Life Span: 12 to 17 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>The Siamese and the Colorpoint Shorthair might differ in color, but beneath the skin they are identical. The Colorpoint Shorthair is talkative and opinionated. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, in a loud, raspy voice, and he expects you to pay attention and act on his advice. Colorpoints are extremely fond of their people. They like to be “helpful” and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, a Colorpoint Shorthair will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow.</p>
						<p>Do not get a Colorpoint if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, a Colorpoint can be your best friend. Just be sure you have time to spend with this demanding and social cat. Colorpoints do not like being left alone for long periods, and if you work during the day it can be smart to get two of them so they can keep each other company.</p>
						<p>The Colorpoint is highly intelligent, agile and athletic, and loves to play. Keep his busy brain active with puzzle toys and his body exercised with teaser toys that he can chase and a big cat tree he can climb. He is fully capable of opening doors and drawers or rifling through your purse in search of something interesting or shiny to play with. Never leave him without any form of entertainment, or you will likely come home to find that he has reprogrammed your DVR to record only nature shows or at the very least decided that your toilet paper rolls and tissue boxes look better empty.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>Except for color, the Siamese and the Colorpoint are indistinguishable, having a svelte but muscular body with long lines and a wedge-shaped head that is long and tapering from the narrow point of the nose outward to the tips of the ears, forming a triangle. The unusually large ears are wide at the base and pointed at the tip, giving them the same triangular shape as the head. Medium-size eyes are almond-shaped. The body is often described as tubular and is supported by long, slim legs, with the hind legs higher than the front legs. The Colorpoint walks on small, dainty, oval paws and swishes a long, thin tail that tapers to a fine point.</p>
						<p>Colorpoints come in 16 colors and patterns, including  red point, cream point and lynx point. The coat often darkens as the cat ages. Eyes are a vivid blue.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>The short, fine coat of the Colorpoint is easily cared for. Comb it every couple of weeks with a stainless steel comb or soft bristle brush to remove dead hair, then polish it with a soft cloth to make it shine.</p>
						<p>Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.</p>

				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info left">
						<h2>Himalayan</h2>
						<p>The Himalayan, or Himmie for short, is a Persian in Siamese drag, affectionate but discriminating.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Cat Breed Group: Longhair</li>
							<li>Height: 10-12 in</li>
							<li>Weight: 11-13 lb </li>
							<li>Life Span: 9 to 15 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>Like the Persian, the Himalayan is sweet, docile and quiet. She is an ornament to any home where she can enjoy sitting in a lap—surely her rightful place—being petted by those who are discerning enough to recognize her superior qualities, and playing house with kind children who will gently comb her hair, wheel her around in a baby buggy (but not dress her up), let her chase an interactive toy, then serve her tea at their parties. Himalayans are affectionate but discriminating.</p>
						<p>They reserve their attention for family members and those few guests whom they feel they can trust. Loud environments aren’t a Himalayan’s style; they are sedate cats who prefer a serene home where little changes from day to day. With large, expressive eyes and a voice that has been described as soft, pleasant and musical, Himmies let their simple needs be known: regular meals, a little playtime with a catnip mouse or feather teaser, and lots of love, which they return tenfold. This is one cat who is unlikely to climb up your curtains, jump on your kitchen counters, or perch on top of your refrigerator. She is perfectly happy to rule her domain from the floor or more accessible pieces of furniture. When you are at work or are busy around the house, the Himalayan is content to adorn a chair, sofa or bed until you are free to admire her and give her the attention she willingly receives but never demands.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>In all respects but coat pattern, the Himalayan shares the Persian’s sweet expression and soft round lines. It has a large, round head; large, round eyes; a short nose; full cheeks; and small ears with rounded tips. The head is supported by a short, thick neck and a deceptively sturdy, muscular body—a type known as “cobby.” A Himalayan’s legs are short, thick and strong with large, round, firm paws. The tail is short but proportional to the length of the cat’s body.</p>
						<p>A long, thick, shiny coat with a fine texture completes the Himalayan’s look. It’s long all over the body and includes an immense ruff around the neck, a deep frill between the front legs, long ear and toe tufts, and a full “brush,” or tail. The Himalayan is bred in the following point colors: chocolate, seal, lilac, blue, red, cream tortie, blue-cream, chocolate-tortie, lilac-cream, seal lynx, blue lynx, red lynx, cream lynx, tortie lynx, blue-cream lynx, chocolate lynx, lilac lynx, chocolate-tortie lynx and lilac-cream lynx. The body is various shades of white to fawn with color only on the facial mask and the feet, ears and tail. Unlike the Persian and the Exotic, the Himalayan’s eyes come in only one color: a deep, vivid blue.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>The most important thing to understand about caring for a Himalayan is the need for daily grooming. That long, beautiful coat doesn’t stay clean and tangle-free on its own. It must be gently but thoroughly combed every day, and regular bathing—at least once a month—is a good idea. Another factor to consider is the litter box issue. Litter may become lodged in a Himalayan’s paws or coat. If the cat and the litter box aren’t kept scrupulously clean, a Himmie is more likely than most to just stop using the box.</p>
						<p>Excessive tearing can be a problem in this breed, so wipe the corners of the eyes clean daily to prevent under-eye stains from forming. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing.</p>

				<div class="content">
					<div class="pet-info right">
						<h2>Russian Blue</h2>
						<p>The Russian Blue’s elegant yet muscular body led one cat judge to proclaim him the “Doberman Pinscher of cats.”</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Cat Breed Group: Shorthair</li>
							<li>Height: 8-10 in </li>
							<li>Weight: 8-12 lb </li>
							<li>Life Span: 10 to 15 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>The Russian Blue has a reputation as a gentle, quiet cat, somewhat shy, but don’t get the wrong idea. This cat may have a reserved nature, but he loves to play (being especially fond of retrieving) and enjoys jumping or climbing to high places where he can study people and situations at his leisure before making up his mind about whether he wants to get involved. Guests will not receive his immediate attention and may never see him unless he decides they are worthy of his notice, but toward family members, especially his favored person, he is ever loyal, following them through the house and even riding on a shoulder. The Russian Blue is a sensitive cat who doesn’t like to be ignored and will be hurt if he doesn’t receive the same amount of affection he gives. Lack of attention can cause him to become anxious or fearful. While the Russian Blue loves your company, he is capable of entertaining himself during the day while you are at work. Unlike some active, intelligent breeds, he is not destructive but moves through the house with the lithe grace of a Russian ballerina. When you are at home, his subtle sense of humor and manual dexterity will never fail to entertain. Just make sure you laugh with him, not at him. He has a strong sense of self-worth and doesn’t like being made fun of. This is a cat who does best in a quiet, stable environment. He doesn’t like change, and it’s especially important to him that meals arrive on time. Count on him to be a faithful alarm clock in the morning, not so you don’t miss work but so he doesn’t miss a meal. If you take the time to develop a relationship with a Russian Blue, your reward will be a deep bond with this loving cat.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>The Russian Blue’s elegant yet muscular body led one cat judge to proclaim him the “Doberman Pinscher of cats.” He has what’s called a semi-foreign body type, meaning it is moderate in shape, falling somewhere between the short, compact body of breeds such as Persians and the sleek angles of Oriental breeds such as the Siamese. The Cat Fanciers Association breed standard for the Russian Blue calls for him to have a head that is a smooth, medium-size wedge shape with a blunt muzzle. The broad wedge of the head and its flat skull are often described as cobra-like, although that is much too dangerous a description for this sweet-natured cat. Regal is perhaps a better term. Large ears are wide at the base with pointed tips, the interior lined with thin, translucent skin, and rounded vivid green eyes are set wide apart. A long, slender neck segues into high shoulder blades and a fine-boned body that is firm and muscular, covered with a short, thick double coat with a plush texture, often described as similar to that of a seal or beaver. If you were to run your fingers through a Russian Blue’s coat, the patterns they made would remain until they were petted smooth. The body is supported by long, fine-boned legs set on small, slightly rounded paws with pads that are a pinky lavender or mauve shade. The tail is long but in proportion to the body. The Russian Blue stands out for his coat color. To the uninformed, he might look gray, but in cat show terms he is an even, bright blue with silver-tipped hairs that make him seem to glisten. Some Russian Blue kittens are born with “ghost stripes,” a reminder of the tabby gene that all cats carry, even if it isn’t expressed in their coat, but these generally fade, leaving the cat with the solid blue coat of maturity. You might think that a Russian Blue would only come in blue, and in CFA that is true, but other cat associations have more liberal breed standards. In Australia and New Zealand, the cats are called “Russians” and come in white and black as well as the traditional blue. The American Cat Fanciers Association permits black Russians.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>The Russian Blue’s dense coat should be combed twice a week to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. A bath when the cat is shedding will help to remove excess hair more quickly. Keep the Russian Blue’s litter box spotlessly clean. He is very particular about bathroom hygiene. It’s a good idea to keep a Russian Blue as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Russian Blues who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.</p>

						<h2>Savannah</h2>
						<p>A hybrid of a domestic feline and a medium-size African wild cat, the Savannah is a challenging and rewarding companion.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Cat Breed Group: Shorthair</li>
							<li>Height: 14-17 in</li>

						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>If you want to live with a sweet, quiet lap cat, don’t get a Savannah. This is an active, adventurous feline who enjoys life in the fast lane. Her athletic body allows her to jump to very high places, and her questing spirit leads her to take well to walks on leash, seek out water to play in, and thoroughly explore her surroundings. This is a confident, alert, curious, and friendly cat. While some cats are retiring sorts, most Savannahs are gracious hosts who will greet your guests with aplomb, as well as close companions who will want to spend time interacting with you. Be sure you have a well-developed sense of humor if you live with one of these cats; they are not above playing jokes on you. It takes a highly intelligent person to outwit a Savannah. You may need to switch faucet styles to prevent them from turning on their own private waterworks, or attach childproof locks to keep them out of cabinets. Don’t forget to protect breakables. Put them away where the Savannah can’t knock them over as she makes one of her famous leaps, and ensure electrical cords are protected from gnawing kittens. Provide a Savannah with toys that will stand up to rough play and interactive games that will challenge her mind. To live happily with a Savannah, plan to spend plenty of time interacting with her. Be sure she has interesting toys to occupy her when you’re not around. Reward her when she does things you like, and redirect her energy and interests when she does things you don’t like. Protect special belongings by putting them out of reach. If all of this sounds like too much work, choose a different cat.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>Savannahs come in several different colors and patterns: black, brown, or black spotted tabby; black silver spotted tabby; and black smoke. Most have solid black or dark brown spots on golden, cream, sandy, or white backgrounds. They stand out for their bold, solid markings, which can be round, oval, or elongated. Some Savannahs have what’s called a marble pattern, in which the spots resemble an elongated bull’s-eye. Because domestic shorthairs figured in their ancestry, some Savannahs come in colors and patterns that aren’t described in the breed standard, including chocolate, cinnamon, blue, red, and colorpoint. Savannahs that are non-standard colors can be registered but not shown. The Savannah’s triangular head is supported by a long neck and topped by large, wide ears. The medium-size eyes can be any color. Nose leather ranges from pink to black, but black Savannahs must have solid black nose leather. A Savannah has a medium-length tail. If she were an athlete, the tall and lean Savannah would be heavily recruited by all the best basketball teams. Her unusual height comes from her long-legged serval ancestor. It takes a Savannah approximately three years to reach adult size. A kitten who looks average in size may rocket up in height after she’s 3 months old. She usually achieves his height in the first year and then her body fills out over the next couple of years. Interesting fact: the back legs are slightly longer than the front legs.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>Brush a Savannah’s short to medium-length coat once or twice a week to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. It’s a good idea to provide a Savannah with a large outdoor enclosure or to keep her as an indoor-only cat to prevent diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors (such as being hit by a car). Savannahs who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have a unique and beautiful cat without paying for it. Be aware some cities or states have laws against keeping hybrid or exotic animals. While the cats registered with TICA are considered fully domestic, a first- or second-generation Savannah (meaning one who has a serval as a parent or grandparent) may face restrictions. Check the laws in your area before purchasing any Savannah that could fall under laws governing hybrids. Check the Hybrid Law for more information.</p>

						<h2>Sphynx</h2>
						<p>It’s a good thing that the hairless Sphynx loves attention because he draws it wherever he goes. He is demanding of human attention and will do anything for a laugh.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Vital Stats:</h3>
						<ul>

							<li>Life Span: 8 to 14 years </li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3>Personality</h3>
						<p>It’s a good thing that the Sphynx loves attention because he draws it wherever he goes. He is demanding of human attention and will do anything for a laugh. “Look at me!” is his catchphrase. That makes him easy to handle by veterinarians or anyone else, and it’s not unusual for a Sphynx to be a therapy cat since he is so fond of meeting people. When he is not receiving the attentions of his adoring fans, the curious and energetic Sphynx is exploring his surroundings, climbing his cat tree or otherwise seeking high places, chasing a bug or just generally getting into mischief. He is extremely fond of teaser toys and puzzle toys that challenge his athleticism and brains.</p>
						<p>This is a highly social cat. If you are gone during the day, the Sphynx will enjoy having a friend in the form of another Sphynx, another cat or even a dog. He likes the company and, equally important, he likes having someone to snuggle with so that he stays warm. He loves to be held, and you can expect him to sleep with you, most likely under the covers. Think of it as having a living hot water bottle.</p>

						<h3>Coat And Color</h3>
						<p>Bald, wrinkled and potbellied, the Sphynx is sometimes proclaimed to be ugly, but only by those who have a shallow understanding of beauty. His unusual body shape and the physiological and emotional warmth he emits are what attract people to him. Much like an apricot, the hard, muscular body of the Sphynx can be smooth or covered with a fine, soft down. The nose, toes, ears and tail may also have a light covering of fur. To hug him is to melt into the warmth of his suedelike coat. A Sphynx does not have a higher body temperature than other cats, but it seems like it because there is no fur to serve as insulation.</p>
						<p>A broad chest and a well-rounded abdomen give him the appearance of having eaten just a little too much at dinnertime, but he should not be fat. Supporting the body are firm, muscular legs set on oval paws with long, slender toes. Thick paw pads make the Sphynx look as if he is walking on “air cushions.” A long, slender, flexible tail is described as whiplike. A Sphynx with a little tuft of fur on the end of the tail is said to have a lion tail. Sphynx kittens are heavily wrinkled, but as they grow the wrinkles smooth out, although some remain throughout the cat’s life. A Sphynx should not be so wrinkled that eyesight or other functions are compromised.</p>
						<p>The head of the Sphynx is a modified wedge shape, slightly longer than it is wide, with prominent cheekbones, large ears and large, lemon-shaped eyes. Whiskers and eyebrows are sparse to nonexistent. The Sphynx comes in all colors and patterns, including white, black, red, chocolate, lavender, various tabby patterns, tortoiseshell, calico, bicolor, and pointed and mink patterns. The color is seen in the pigment of the skin as well as in whatever hair the cat has and can sometimes be difficult to distinguish.</p>

						<h3>Care</h3>
						<p>Despite his bald body, a Sphynx requires at least as much grooming as cats with fur and maybe even more. Their skin must be kept moisturized with a gentle, scent-free lotion or oil, and they need weekly baths so as not to leave greasy spots on your furniture and clothing. Use a gentle baby shampoo or moisturizing shampoo and rinse thoroughly, especially between the folds of the wrinkles. If you begin bathing your Sphynx kitten while he is young, he will learn to accept and sometimes even enjoy baths. Baby wipes will help to keep him clean between baths.</p>
						<p>Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Wipe the corners of the eyes daily with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.</p>
